.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
Openbox is minimalistic, highly configurable, next generation window 
manager with extensive standards support. 
.PP 
You can start Openbox in three ways: 
.PP 
If you run a display manager such as GDM, you will find 3 entries 
in the login session type menu for Openbox: 
\fBGNOME/Openbox\fR, \fBKDE/Openbox\fR       and \fBOpenbox\fR. If you want to use Openbox 
within GNOME or KDE, you can choose the appropriate entry, and it will 
launch GNOME or KDE with Openbox as the window manager. 
.PP 
The third option at log in, which is \fBOpenbox\fR       without a session manager, uses the \fBopenbox-session\fR       command to start Openbox. On log in, \fBopenbox\fR will 
run the ~/.config/openbox/autostart.sh script if it exists, and will run 
the system-wide script @configdir@/openbox/autostart.sh otherwise. You 
may place anything you want to run automatically in those files, for 
example: 
 
.PP 
.RS 
.PP 
.nf 
xsetroot \-solid grey & 
gnome-settings-daemon & 
.fi 
.RE 
.PP 
Make sure that each line is followed by a "&" or else the script will 
stop there and further commands will not be executed. You can use the 
@configdir@/openbox/autostart.sh file as an example for creating your 
own. 
.PP 
The default @configdir@/openbox/autostart.sh runs a number of things 
with Openbox. 
.PP 
Lastly, if you use \fBstartx\fR to launch your X 
session, you can set up a ~/.xinitrc file to run 
\fBopenbox-session\fR and follow the same directions as 
above regarding the autostart.sh file. 
.PP 
You can use the \fBobconf\fR tool to configure Openbox 
easily with a graphical interface, however more in-depth configuration 
is possible by editing the configuration files by hand. 
.PP 
The default configuration and menu files are installed in 
@configdir@/openbox/, and the user configuration is placed in 
~/.config/openbox/. You can copy the default configuration and menus 
to ~/.config/openbox and edit it to your liking. 
.SH "OPTIONS" 
.PP 
These are the possible options that \fBopenbox\fR accepts: 
.IP "\fB\-\-help\fP" 10 
Show a summary of the options available. 
.IP "\fB\-\-version\fP" 10 
Show the version of the program. 
.IP "\fB\-\-replace\fP" 10 
Replace the currently running window manager. 
.IP "\fB\-\-reconfigure\fP" 10 
If Openbox is already running on the display, tell it to 
reload its configuration. 
.IP "\fB\-\-restart\fP" 10 
If Openbox is already running on the display, tell it to 
restart. This is useful if you have upgraded Openbox and don't 
want to restart X. 
.IP "\fB\-\-config-file FILE\fP" 10 
Use FILE for configuration instead of looking for rc.xml 
in the XDG search path. FILE is an absolute path. 
.IP "\fB\-\-sm-disable\fP" 10 
Do not connect to the session manager. 
.IP "\fB\-\-sync\fP" 10 
Run in synchronous mode (for debugging). 
.IP "\fB\-\-debug\fP" 10 
Display debugging output. 
.IP "\fB\-\-debug-focus\fP" 10 
Display debugging output for focus handling. 
.IP "\fB\-\-debug-xinerama\fP" 10 
Split the display into two fake xinerama regions, if 
xinerama is not already enabled. This is for debugging 
xinerama support.
