.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
\fBopenbox-session\fR runs an openbox session without 
any session manager. Without a session manager, you will not be able 
to save your state from one log in to the next. 
.PP 
\fBopenbox-session\fR does not take any command line 
arguments. 
.PP 
On log in, \fBopenbox-session\fR will run the 
~/.config/openbox/autostart.sh script if it exists, and will run the 
system-wide script @configdir@/openbox/autostart.sh otherwise. You may 
place anything you want to run automatically in those files, for example: 
 
.PP 
.RS 
.PP 
.nf 
xsetroot \-solid grey & 
gnome-settings-daemon & 
.fi 
.RE 
.PP 
Make sure that each line is followed by a "&" or else the script will 
stop there and further commands will not be executed. You can use the 
@configdir@/openbox/autostart.sh file as an example for creating your 
own.
