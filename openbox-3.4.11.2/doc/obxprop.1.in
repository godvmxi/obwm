.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
obxprop is a tool for displaying the properties on an x 
window. 
.PP 
This tool has a similar functionality to \fBxprop\fR, 
but obxprop allows you to see UTF-8 strings as text. 
.PP 
You may use the \fB\-\-id\fR option to specify a window 
identifier, otherwise obxprop will allow you to select a window by 
clicking on it.

Primarily, this tool exists for Openbox users to see the value of the 
_OB_NAME, _OB_CLASS, and _OB_ROLE properties, which Openbox uses for 
matching windows against user-defined application rules. 
.SH "OPTIONS" 
.PP 
These are the possible options that \fBopenbox\fR accepts:

.IP "ID" 10

requested.
